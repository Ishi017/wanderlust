            <p>
                Wanderlust is a platform dedicated to helping people find the perfect place to stay during their vacations. Founded by <b>Ishita </b>, Wanderlust was born out of a passion for travel and a desire to make it easier for people to share their homes with travelers from around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our journey began with a simple idea: to connect travelers with unique accommodations and allow homeowners to monetize their extra space. Over the years, we have grown into a trusted community marketplace where people can list, discover, and book accommodations worldwide.
            </p>

                <b>Ishita </b>'s dedication to travel and hospitality has shaped Wanderlust into a platform that values trust, safety, and exceptional customer service. We are committed to creating a seamless and enjoyable experience for both hosts and guests.
